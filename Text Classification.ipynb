We have several\\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \\n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \\nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \\nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\\n\\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.

The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\\nwake from sleep.\\n\\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\\n\\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\\n\\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\\ncompatible with the slower chips.\\n\\n     > Space.

Mostly, that means water\\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \\nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\\n\\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\\nis clearly appropriate.\\n\\n>>  Plus these things have no self-\\n>>defense purposes.

If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn\\'t overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn\\'t defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren\\'t suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn\\'t clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia\\'s firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia\\'s\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\\na roughly equal share of the militia\\'s firepower: His personal\\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad\\'s heavier firepower.\\n\\n                                                  Frank Crary\\n                                                  CU Boulder\\n\\n',\n"," \"From: mse@cc.bellcore.com (25836-michael evenchick(F113))\\nSubject: Re: BEST FIRST BASEMEN...\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr20.102857.1@tesla.njit.edu>, drm6640@tesla.njit.edu says:\\n>\\n>DON MATTINGLY IS THE BEST FIRST BASEMAN IN THE HISTORY OF BASEBALL.....ALWAYS\\n>HAS BEEN.....ALWAYS WILL BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nAlways has been??????\\n\\nEven before he was even conceived of?

But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\\n\\'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\\nplaymaking skills that made him the team\\'s leading scorer among defensemen last\\nyear.

He, then,\\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\\'s most\\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\\n\\n#5\\tNEIL WILKINSON\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB-\\n\\nWilkinson was probably the team\\'s top defensive defenseman in \\'91-92.  However,\\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\\n\\n#6\\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A)\\n\\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\\nbut he still finished as the team\\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\\'s abilities.  At the time, he\\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.

He was solid on defense, but\\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\\'t show it (15 points).\\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.

Results of their research\\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\\nRadiology.\\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\\nfor Alzheimer\\'s disease calls for lengthy memory function and\\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\\n   In addition to Alzheimer\\'s disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease and Huntington\\'s\\ndisease.\\n   \"We\\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\\'s earlier and\\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\\nwith Alzheimer\\'s showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer\\'s disease is widely\\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer\\'s is caused by an\\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer\\'s were based\\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\\nAlzheimer\\'s from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\\nand a co-author of the study.\\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\\nand will be configured for other manufacturers\\' MRI units soon.\\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\\n\\n   Q & A on Alzheimer\\'s Disease:\\n\\n   What is Alzheimer\\'s disease and how is it caused?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\\n   How many people does it affect?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer\\'s\\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\\nemotionally and financially, for patients\\' families.  AD is the\\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\\nsuggests the following criteria:\\n\\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\\n      normal.\\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\\n\\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer\\'s disease and other forms\\nof dementia.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n',\n"," \"From: system@kalki33.lakes.trenton.sc.us (Kalki Dasa)\\nSubject: Bhagavad-Gita 2.44\\n\\n                                TEXT 44\\n\\n                       bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam\\n                           tayapahrta-cetasam\\n                        vyavasayatmika buddhih\\n                          samadhau na vidhiyate\\n  \\nbhoga--to material enjoyment; aisvarya--and opulence; prasaktanam--for\\nthose who are attached; taya--by such things;\\napahrta-cetasam--bewildered in mind; vyavasaya-atmika--fixed in\\ndetermination; buddhih--devotional service to the Lord; samadhau--in\\nthe controlled mind; na--never; vidhiyate--does take place.\\n    \\n                              TRANSLATION\\n\\n\\tIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and\\nmaterial opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute\\ndetermination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take\\nplace.\\n  \\n                                PURPORT\\n\\n\\tSamadhi means ``fixed mind.''

Philbrick had become an\\nAmerican folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting\\ncolleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films\\nportraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In\\nBoston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist\\nParty member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert\\nPhilbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque.\\n\\nFor Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his\\nhomosexuality in the straight-arrow \\'50s, the life of a double agent\\nwas the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist\\nmenace.\\n\\n\"I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick,\" Bullock recently told\\nfederal investigators, \"and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the\\nCommunist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student\\nFestival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI\\na full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of\\nsome Soviet military vehicles.\"\\n\\nBullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid\\ninformant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a\\npaid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities\\nare at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent\\nAmerican history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL\\'s criminal\\nindictment in San Francisco.\\n\\nOver a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876\\nindividuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,\\nincluding the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian\\nMovement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,\\nPalestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans\\nfor Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even\\nspied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when\\nhe visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on\\nanti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,\\nbetween 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a\\nprominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its\\nfinancial relationship with Bullock.\\n\\nLast month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San\\nFrancisco, as well as Bullock\\'s home, confiscating computer files and\\nboxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock\\'s files\\ncontained the driver\\'s license and vehicle registration information,\\nin addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was\\nallegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told\\nthe FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base\\nhad been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  \"Based on the\\nevidence,\" says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, \"I believe\\nthat Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them\\nwith confidential criminal and DMV information.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for\\ntapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false\\nidentities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from\\nBullock\\'s home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area\\ntrash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the\\nChristic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message\\nslips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),\\noffice correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the\\nsenders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic\\nInstitute\\'s bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,\\nas well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the\\ndates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic\\nInstitute\\'s checking account.\\n\\nInvestigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed\\nthat the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material\\nwith Israeli government officials.  What\\'s more, Israel apparently used\\ntips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.\\n\\n                            *     *     *\\n\\nThe ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and\\nlater other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight\\nagainst racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the\\nAmerican Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights\\nmovement.\\n\\nBut there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on\\nleftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House\\nCommittee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung\\nsharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a\\nbastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite\\nwho heads the ADL\\'s powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger\\nto Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,\\nblacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in\\nAmerica, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his\\nideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL\\'s vast\\nnetwork of informants, who were given code names like \"Scumbag,\"\\n\"Ironside,\" and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta\\n-- \"Flipper.\"\\n\\nFor years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community\\nknew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets\\nwere anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon\\nLarouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock\\ncase reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,\\nand progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil\\nliberties may end with the ADL\\'s criminal indictment in San Francisco,\\nwhere the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible\\ncriminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an\\nindictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one\\nsource close to the West Coast investigation, \"It is 99 per cent\\ncertain that the ADL will be indicted.\"\\n\\nIn the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL\\nspying are spreading to other parts of the country.  \"We have received\\nnumerous complaints about ADL [spying],\" says Sam Adams, a\\nspokesperson for the mayor\\'s office in Portland, Oregon.\\n\\nOn April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and\\nAfrican American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,\\nwrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting \"an immediate\\ninvestigation\" of the ADL.  \"The ADL\\'s actions cause great concern, as\\nit is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil\\nrights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San\\nFrancisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism.\"\\n\\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau\\'s office, says, \"We\\nhave no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation.\"\\nMcKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San\\nFrancisco D.A.\\'s office on their pending investigation.  \"They have\\nnot, so far, asked for our assistance.\"\\n\\nThe ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with\\nlaw enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive\\nfiles on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page\\npress release, \"The vast majority of ADL\\'s files are composed of news\\nclips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents....\"\\n\\n\"ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance\\nviolations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,\\nand the process by which the League gathers information is presently\\nunder review to insure that no laws are being violated.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low\\nthat its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And\\neven as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show\\nof solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish\\nofficials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human\\nrights group or a secret police agency.\\n\\n\"The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the\\nJewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-\\nSemitism and extremist groups,\" says Daniel Levitas, the former\\nexecutive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-\\nbased group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups.\\n\"One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely\\ntainted the ADL\\'s credibility and reputation with regard to its\\nobjectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the\\nJewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous\\nwith American Jewry.\"\\n\\n                            *     *     *\\n\\nBullock\\'s talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well\\nwith the ADL\\'s Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to Southern\\nCalifornia where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock\\nalmost always used his real name when snooping, although he once\\ncalled himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of\\nAlabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL\\'s office in\\nLos Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact\\nFinding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.\\nUnder Suall\\'s stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the\\nADL\\'s heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across\\nfrom the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library\\non \"hate groups,\" culling material from publications, speeches, and\\ninformants reports.\\n\\nBullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after\\nmoving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John\\nBirch Society who helped him gain access to the group\\'s Boston office.\\nThere, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The\\ndiscovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that\\nthey had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.\\n\\nBullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups\\nuntil the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by\\nHarvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A\\nfew years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco\\nwhere he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had\\ninfiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the\\nensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate\\nthe Arabs.\\n\\nThe ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-\\nDiscrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator\\nJames Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA\\'s\\ndirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock\\njoined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently\\ntrying to discredit it, according to published reports.\\n\\nIn 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of\\nArab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court\\ndocuments, Bullock was told to find the source of the group\\'s funds.\\nBullock was unable to \"follow the money.\"  But he did such a good job\\nat ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA\\ndelegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nIt\\'s not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But\\nonly acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As\\nfar as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily\\ninfiltrated by what he called \"gay left revolutionaries,\" prompting\\nhim to write about their activities for the ADL.\\n\\nBullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of\\nforeign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL\\'s San\\nFrancisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was\\nthen a detective with the San Francisco Police Department\\'s\\nIntelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the\\nCIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more\\nthan a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching\\nGerard\\'s briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and\\ninterrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as\\npassports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas\\nClouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines\\nwhere he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he\\nwill blow the lid off the CIA\\'s involvement with Latin American death\\nsquads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)\\n\\nAfter their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock\\nhad lunch at McDonald\\'s, \"I liked Tom right off,\" Bullock later told a\\nSan Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation\\nwas obtained by the _Voice_.  \"Tom is a very charming, roguish\\ncharacter, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, I\\nconsider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I\\'ve ever worked\\nwith, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent\\nAmerican.\"\\n\\nBefore long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL\\nreports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gave\\nBullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,\\nskinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard\\'s material\\nended up in his ADL reports.  \"I would say 99 percent of the data that\\nI got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminal\\nhistory, very rarely,\" Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave\\nBullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American\\nbusinessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East\\nterror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans\\nreceiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs\\nin New York gave Gerard the photos.  \"It was understood that Bullock\\nwould be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard\\ngave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or\\nother law enforcement officers,\" says an FBI report.\\n\\nThere was nothing unusual about Bullock\\'s cozy relationship with law\\nenforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with\\nhundreds of \"official friends,\" the organization\\'s euphemism for U.S.\\nlaw enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL\\'s relationship with\\nthe FBI\\'s counterterrorism office was so close that ADL\\'s reports on\\nArab American group\\'s covert ties to Middle East terrorists were \"must\\nreading.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report\\nentitled \"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New\\nYork Area\" while searching the ADL\\'s San Francisco office.  In 1987,\\nADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in\\nCalifornia universities on student visas.  When the ADL discovered\\nthey were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in\\nturn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\\nAfter the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL\\nregional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_\\nabout his office\\'s cooperation with law enforcement, although he\\'s\\nbackpedaling now.  The \"Los Angeles 8\" deportation is still under\\nappeal.\\n\\n                            *     *     *\\n\\nWhile the ADL worked quietly with America\\'s top cops, it enjoyed\\nsimilar ties with Israel\\'s spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders\\nvehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin\\nEpstein wrote to B\\'nai B\\'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,\\nrequesting $25,000 for his investigators.  \"Our information,\" he\\nboasted to Joftes, \"in addition to being essential for our own\\noperations, has been of great value and service to both the United\\nStates Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been made\\navailable to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are\\nthe source.\"\\n\\nIn 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard\\nspy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy\\'s Anti-Terrorist Alert\\nCenter, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,\\nJonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for\\nIsrael, which, according to federal prosecutors, \"could fill a room\\nthe size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet.\"\\nPollard\\'s handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose\\nwife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote to\\nfriends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli\\nspy operation.\\n\\nWhile there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was\\ninvolved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes\\ninformation to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBI\\ninterrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until\\n1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police\\ninformation to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\\nThe FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information\\nto Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law\\nenforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a\\nradical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco\\nInternational Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputy\\nIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  \"Later the same\\nday,\" according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the\\n_Voice_, \"Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from\\nthe Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information\\nabout Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man\\'s name, but their\\nconversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was\\nactually an Israeli Consulate official.\"\\n\\nAmong the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL\\nfiles in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago\\nresident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly\\ndistributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large\\nIslamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  The\\nChicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work\\nwith \"official friends\" in local law enforcement, according to\\ndocuments released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the\\nADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has\\npassed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.\\n\\nOne technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American\\ncommunity in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral\\nnotices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL\\ninvestigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,\\nwhich sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have been\\ndetained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been\\nfilmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the\\nexecutive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an\\nArab member of Israel\\'s Knesset.\\n\\nShortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced\\nthat Hamas was being run from America with money and operational\\ninstructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel\\'s charges were played\\nup on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-\\nplaced sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked\\nclosely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,\\nintroducing \"friendly\" reporters to \"official friends\" in Chicago law\\nenforcement.\\n\\nBarsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how\\nHamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamic\\nassociation for Palestine in North America as the front organization\\nfor Hamas in the U.S.A.  \"Its infrastructure functions as an\\ninterlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and\\nindividual activists,\" says the February 1993 ADL report, which\\noutlines the organization\\'s development, its activities on U.S.\\ncollege campuses, and its \"metamorphosis\" during the Gulf War. It\\nalso traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-\\ngroups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It is\\ndoubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data\\nwithout the help of \"official friends\" and ADL spies.\\n\\nBarsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as\\nmany as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for\\nAIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_.\\n\"The level of cooperation was very close,\" Slabodkin said during a\\nrecent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school.\\n\"If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL.\"\\n\\nWhen Sha\\'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in\\nthe Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in\\n1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man\\'s entire\\npolice file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarin\\nhad been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to\\nbeing a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.\\nJabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty\\nInternational Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and the\\nADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs\\non him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a\\nrepresentative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that\\nemployed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a file\\non musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok\\naward.\\n\\nWhile the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of\\nArabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder\\ntime explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\\nDavid Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact\\nfinder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged\\nwith information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-\\napartheid groups.  \"Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely\\ncollect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in\\nthe United States,\" says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said there\\nwere files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated\\nthe oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the\\nlate 1970s, paralleling Begin\\'s rise to power in Israel and a\\ndeepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. \"In\\nabout August, 1992,\" says the report of the FBI\\'s March 3, 1993,\\ninterview with Gurvitz, \"an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at\\nthe South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in the\\ndemonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist\\nWorkers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,\\nand a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on each\\nof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of the\\nreports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San\\nFrancisco ADL office.\"\\n\\nIn 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African\\nConsulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting\\norganized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby.\\n\"Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,\"\\nsays the FBI report, \"Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want\\nto warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul\\nGeneral, who canceled his appearance.\"\\n\\nA few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African\\nintelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in a\\nhotel near Fisherman\\'s Wharf, the South African said he was interested\\nin acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  The\\nSouth African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for\\ninformation about groups that were advocating divestments.  \"Gerard,\\nwho was present throughout the meeting,\" says the FBI report, \"told\\nHumphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries\\noffered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.\\nBullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted\\nwas already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL.\"\\n\\nBetween 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African\\nintelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with\\nGerard.  \"Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never\\nexplicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have\\nbeen telling the CIA about his and Bullock\\'s contacts with the South\\nAfricans,\" says the FBI report.  \"Gerard had said he knew the CIA\\n\\'resident agent\\' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped\\nBullock off at Bullock\\'s residence following a meeting with Louie [who\\nreplaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go\\nto the San Francisco CIA office.\"\\n\\nAl the while, Gerard may have been \"tasking\" Bullock for the CIA.\\n\"Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to\\nChicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,\"\\nsays the FBI report.  \"The target of the investigation was a group\\ncalled the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that a\\nwoman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the\\nPFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerard\\nlater told Bullock that Gerard\\'s \\'guy at the CIA\\' would like to know\\nmore.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to\\ngather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.\\nBullock, however, never did go back.\"\\n\\nGerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which\\nmay have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  The\\nADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials\\nto Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts\\nin various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by San\\nFrancisco police inspector Roth, the \"all-expense paid trip [to\\nIsrael] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the\\nADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law\\nenforcement officers from the United States.\"\\n\\nGerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time after\\ntravelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad\\'s\\nrescue of Ethiopian Jews.\\n\\nAs Gerard\\'s relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more\\nopenly about his exploits in the CIA.  \"Bullock recalled Gerard\\nmentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that\\nGerard discussed the PLO and \\'safehouses,\\'\" says the FBI report, \"To\\nthis Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined\\nthat the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.\\nGerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....\\nLouie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South\\nAfrica as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded \\'war\\nstories\\' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of \\'narrow\\nscrapes.\\'\"\\n\\nAlthough there is still much mystery about what triggered law\\nenforcement\\'s investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of\\na classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI\\'s San\\nFrancisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered the\\nreport in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent a\\ncopy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL\\'s fact finding\\ndivision in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for\\n_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam\\nshould not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.\\nbecause the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, who\\nhad arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,\\ntestified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had\\nworked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the\\nDefense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Boland\\nadmitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-\\nonly ADL conference.)\\n\\nAfter he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the\\nPhilippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard is\\nbelieved to have supplied information from police computers not only\\nto the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _San\\nFrancisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating\\nfederal espionage laws.\\n\\nAlthough Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall\\npraised him in a July 1992 memo as \"our number one investigator,\" the\\nADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADL\\nalso asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than\\njournalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don\\'t journalists keep\\nfiles?\\n\\nBut the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL\\'s\\nmethod of gathering information couldn\\'t be more striking.\\nJournalists place information in the public domain where they are held\\naccountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the most\\npart, journalists don\\'t share their investigative files with foreign\\nand domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.\\nBecause many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false\\ninformation collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be\\ncorrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the\\nJewish thought police.\\n\\n\"The ADL says it\\'s a human rights group not just for Jews but for\\neveryone,\" says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the\\nMassachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors\\nright-wing extremist groups.  \"That\\'s fine but it can\\'t do that and\\nspy on Palestinians.  It\\'s blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.\"\\n\\n\"My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of the\\nhats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rights\\ngroup that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.\\nIt is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.\\nNothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,\\nconsistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which\\nagain is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains an\\ninformation-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there is\\nnothing wrong for a group to do that.\"\\n\\n\"But you can\\'t do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and not\\nviolate the bounds of ethics.  There\\'s a built-in conflict of interest\\nif you wear all four hats.\"\\n\\nADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.\\nIn a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: \"ADL\\nhas a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil\\nrights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort or\\nmotive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is\\nfalse and baseless\"\\n\\n\"Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC\\'s spying], Friedman describes the\\ndissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence\\nof files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction is\\nmisleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,\\npolitician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem\\nrelevant; tracing the logic of Friedman\\'s reckless charges, the\\nLibrary of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminating\\nthe public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor\\nMcCarthyism.\"\\n\\nBut many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.\\nAsk Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish\\nAgenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADL\\nexonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted\\nRonald Reagan\\'s covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL\\nleaders.)\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet\\nfact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite\\nLyndon LaRouche.  \"Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this\\nreally terrific investigator,\" says Berlet.  \"So we introduce\\nourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and\\nbasically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political\\nactivities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.\\nObviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds\\nadmirably.  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling\\nvery uncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\"And then he leans forward and says, \\'The right-wing isn\\'t the\\nproblem.  The left-wing is the problem.  The Soviet Union is the\\nbiggest problem in the world for Jews.  It\\'s the American left that is\\nthe biggest threat to American Jews.  You\\'re on the wrong track.\\nYou\\'re part of the problem.\\'  We were stunned.  I was virtually in\\ntears.  This is not how I perceived myself.  We basically stumbled out\\nof there in a daze.\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n               Letters (response to Friedman\\'s article)\\n\\n         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20\\n\\nA LEAGUE OF HIS OWN\\n\\nRobert I. Friedman\\'s assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-\\nDefamation League Is Spying On You.\" May 11] demonstrates that he has\\nan axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.\\nIt also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down\\non his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and\\noutright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from\\nreality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,\\neasily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New\\nYork) and the building in which ADL\\'S San Francisco office is located\\n(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).\\n\\nADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without\\n\"spying\" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for\\nthe law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-\\nJewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor\\nthem primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.\\nThrough the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-\\nSemitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,\\nalthough Friedman\\'s bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL\\'s\\nprimary concern is still the far right.\\n\\nBecause extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL\\ncan learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.\\nFriedman\\'s hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a\\nmanner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some have\\nperformed great service to the American people -- for example, by\\nuncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training\\ncamps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  The\\ninformation ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through\\nthe years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.\\n\\nFriedman\\'s article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that\\nit would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.\\nA few examples:  He states that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in\\nthe [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation,\" and that Pollard\\'s\\nhandler\\'s wife \"worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.\"  Not true.\\nFriedman also states:  \"ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped\\nPalestinian funerals.\"  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was\\nobsessed \"with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\"  Again, not true.\\nWe could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal\\n*his* sources.\\n\\nThe distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further\\nreveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paid\\nRoy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee\\n(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes\\nthe zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large\\nnumber.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock \"nearly\\n$170,000\" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that\\namounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.\\n\\nWhat is accurate about Friedman\\'s story is Chip Berlet\\'s description\\nof ADL\\'s four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and\\ndiscrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,\\nADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement\\nregarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict in\\nthese four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won\\'t\\neither.\\n\\nABRAHAM FOXMAN\\nNational Director\\nAnti-Defamation League\\nManhattan\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES:\\n\\nFor the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd.\\nJournalists don\\'t spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then\\nfreely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence.\\nBut according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators,\\nbuttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the ADL\\ndoes.  Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semitic\\nnor violent.  Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream\\ngroups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now.  Respected intellectuals and\\nMiddle East scholars who disagree with the ADL\\'s political views have\\nended up on ADL blacklists, their reputations smeared.  \"Private\\norganizations have no business paying operatives inside police\\ndepartments or having spies,\" says an April 17 editorial in the _St.\\nLouis Post-Dispatch_, condemning ADL spying.  On April 10, police\\narmed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and\\nL.A. after concluding that \"ADL employees were apparently less than\\ntruthful\" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier\\nsearch, according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth\\'s sworn\\naffidavit.  Roth also asserts that Bullock was a \"paid employee for\\nthe ADL.\"  If so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paid\\nto Bullock, the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts, according\\nto court papers.  The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally\\nobtaining confidential information from police computers.  As for\\nerrors:  The ADL was founded in Chicago, and moved to New York in\\n1947.  But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building\\nshown in the _Voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago.  I never\\nwrote that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Pollard]\\nIsraeli spy operation.\"  I reported that Pollard himself made the\\ncharge.  And in court papers, Pollard\\'s own lawyer said that the wife\\nof Pollard\\'s handler worked for the ADL.  If I have a bias, it is on\\nthe side of the First and Fourth Amendments.\\n\\n',\n"," 'From: Mike.Hahn@p57.f714.n7102.z5.fidonet.org (Mike Hahn)\\nSubject: The doctrine of Original Sin\\n\\nStephen A.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n    says:\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\\n\\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn\\'t sending\\n\\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \\n\\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\\n\\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \\n\\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I\\'m not that good\\n\\tat soldering so I couldn\\'t do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\\n\\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\\n\\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\\n\\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\\n\\tExcel, and many others) \\n\\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\\n\\tthe software on the drive.

Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\\n\\n#24\\tDOUG WILSON\\t\\tSeason: 16th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\\n\\t\\t2nd round pick in \\'92 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\\nwill go down in Scremin\\'s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.

This is basically\\na share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:\\nwhat God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.\\nIt makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers\\nof any possible creature.

He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\\n\\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.

St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as\\ninfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus\\'s \"Against\\nHeresies\", and in Tertullian\\'s \"On Baptism\".

It is not\\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\\n\"mainly about.\"\\n\\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\\n\\n> Okay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\n> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\n> controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\n> extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\n> treatment.

As an example of the second, it would only\\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \\n\\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \\n\\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.

I\\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there\\'s not enough\\nevidence to believe it, or that there\\'s just as good evidence for\\nother religions.  I don\\'t agree, but clearly there are plenty of\\nintelligent people who don\\'t find the evidence convincing.  But that\\ndoesn\\'t seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\\nit are false.\\n\\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that\\'s rather different than\\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\\npeople choose what value to follow, but there\\'s no actual independent\\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it\\'s\\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn\\'t).  The\\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\\nexternal reality.  I hope we\\'re all honest enough not to claim that we\\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don\\'t\\nsee how else we could proceed.\\n\\nThis needn\\'t result in arrogance.  I\\'m certainly interested in talking\\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\\neven if they don\\'t, I respect them as fellow human beings.

But\\nthere is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian\\nand anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by\\nchanging religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric\\nwho brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls\\n\"the people\" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals\\ncall all the Bosnian Muslims \"Turks\" even though they are not ethnically\\nTurk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,\\nwhat is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically\\nidentical but religiously \"other\" is called, paradoxically, \"ethnic\\ncleansing\" rather than \"religious cleansing.\"\\n\\nThus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of\\nWWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from\\nBosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nMike.\\n>\\n--\\nMichael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford College\\nHaverford, Pa 19041-1392\\n',\n"," 'From: anwar+@cs.cmu.edu (Anwar Mohammed)\\nSubject: Re: Remember those names come election time.\\n\\nI said:\\n  In article <C5u4qI.Mz4@apollo.hp.com> nelson_p@apollo.hp.com (Peter Nelson) writes:\\n  >\\n  >  Besides, there\\'s no case that can be made for US military involvement\\n  >  there that doesn\\'t apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or\\n  >  (it appears with the Khmer Rouge\\'s new campaign) Cambodia.

Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.

All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \\nto say this is a new and unique effort.\\n\\n                               END10:25 A.M.

I have heard that there were problems\\n> with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS.  Please tell!\\n\\nI have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good\\nsuccess in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of\\npeople cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command\\n(a truely gnarly hack), but don\\'t believe them.  You also will hear\\npeople saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in\\nMicrosoft\\'s Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:\\n\\n  \"JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if\\n  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for\\n  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives\\n  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use\\n  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.\"\\n\\nWithin this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I\\nhave found a couple of applications that don\\'t deal well with filesystems\\nthat have been \"mounted\" using join.\\n\\nIn particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very\\nconfused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It\\nwants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then\\ndelete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.\\n\\nUnfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic\\nplace other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the\\njoined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original\\n*.doc file, it can\\'t find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you\\nsearch your disk systems, the document is gone.\\n\\nI have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box\\nwhen JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\\\\temp with a 4meg\\nramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an \"ls\" on the c:\\\\temp\\ndir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to \\nreproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think\\nthis is a Windows problem, rather than MKS\\'s, since it works OK under raw\\nDOS.\\n\\nSo, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not\\nbe as robust you would like.\\n\\nWouldn\\'t it be real great to \"mount\" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main\\nfile tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,\\nJOIN won\\'t let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch\\nto let JOIN work on network drives, but I don\\'t remember the source.\\n\\nIt\\'s too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would\\navoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was\\nmeant for casual, even ignorant users, so \"mounting\" all the drives in\\none file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry\\nthis over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant \\nusers -- NOT!).

I won\\'t start\\npanicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but\\nI\\'m a little anxious.

The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just\\n    now happened to be ``ready\\'\\' to release to the world at this time.\\n\\n2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn\\'t able\\n    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I\\n    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy\\n    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the\\n    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for\\n    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made\\n    widely available.)\\n\\nThus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):\\n>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n>electronically.

If it\\nis symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level\\nencryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate\\na per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted\\nthird party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session\\nkey?)\\n\\nIf it\\'s asymmetric, what about PKP\\'s patents, which they claim cover\\nall methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.

The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

The founder of this\\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \\nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \\nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\\n\\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \\ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \\nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \\nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\\n\\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\\ntural backgrounds.\\n\\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement\\'s\\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal brotherhood.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\\n\"NO/don\\'t create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \\n\\n\\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \\n====================\\n\\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\\nnewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third\\nparty.\\n\\nQUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:\\n=====================\\n\\n        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup\\nmay be sent to:\\n     Nabeel A.

EDT\\n\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \\nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \\nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \\nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \\nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \\npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \\nthose who are here.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \\nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \\ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \\nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \\ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \\nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \\ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \\nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \\nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \\ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \\ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \\nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \\ntake us into the future.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \\nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \\nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \\nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \\nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \\njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \\ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \\nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \\ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \\nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \\nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \\non the right track.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \\nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \\nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \\npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \\nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \\nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \\nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \\nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \\n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \\nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \\nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \\nis learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \\nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \\nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \\nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \\npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \\nhere today.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \\neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \\nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \\nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \\nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \\nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \\njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \\ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \\nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \\npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \\nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \\nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \\nfor them to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \\nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \\nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \\nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \\nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \\nI have proposed to create jobs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \\nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \\nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \\npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \\ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \\npeople.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it is especially important for America for two \\nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \\naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \\ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \\neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \\nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \\nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \\nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \\nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \\nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \\norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \\nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \\nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \\ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \\nchance to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \\nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \\nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \\nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \\nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \\nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \\nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \\ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \\nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \\nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \\nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \\ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \\nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \\nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \\nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \\nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \\nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \\nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \\nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \\nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \\nsomething there for them to do?\\n\\n\\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \\nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \\nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \\nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \\nsector.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \\nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \\nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \\nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \\nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \\ncreated before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \\nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \\nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \\nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \\na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \\npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \\nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \\njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \\nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \\ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \\neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \\nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \\npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \\nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \\nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \\ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \\nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \\nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \\nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\\n\\t     \\n\\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \\ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \\nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \\n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \\nthe environment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \\nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \\nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \\nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \\njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \\nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \\npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \\nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \\nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \\nhas never fully emphasized before.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \\nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \\ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \\nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \\nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \\nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \\nyear.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \\nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \\nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \\ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \\nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \\nenvironment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \\nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \\nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \\nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \\nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \\nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \\nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \\nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \\nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \\nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \\nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \\nthey earn, but letting them earn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \\nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \\ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \\nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \\nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \\nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \\nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \\nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \\nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \\nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \\nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \\nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \\nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \\nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \\nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \\nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \\nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \\nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \\nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \\nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \\nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \\nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \\nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \\nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \\nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \\nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \\nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \\ninvestments as well. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \\nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \\nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \\nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \\nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \\nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \\nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \\nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \\nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \\nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \\nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \\nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \\ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \\nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \\nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \\never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \\nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That does not mean young people should not be \\nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \\nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \\nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \\nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \\npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \\ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \\nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \\njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \\npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \\njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \\nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \\nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \\nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \\nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \\nyoung people want.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \\nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \\npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \\nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \\nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \\nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \\noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \\nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \\neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \\nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \\nkidding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \\ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \\ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \\nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \\ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \\nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \\nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \\ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \\ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \\nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \\neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \\nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \\nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \\nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \\nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \\neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \\nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \\nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \\nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \\nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \\nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \\nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \\npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \\nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \\nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \\nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \\nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \\nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \\nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \\nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\n\\n                                 END11:45 A.M.

I do not share this view and there are some \\nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \\nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \\nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \\nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \\nassociated with the infection.\\n\\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\\n\\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \\nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \\nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \\nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \\nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \\nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \\ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \\nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \\ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \\nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \\nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \\nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \\nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I\\'ve worked up so far.\\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \\ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.

Most of the other\\nmodels are in the same class, but aren\\'t the first cars you would think of.\\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn\\'t include domestic small\\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\\nroots.\\n\\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\\n\\nToyota Paseo\\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\\nMazda MX-3\\nIsuzu Impulse\\nGeo Storm\\nFord Escort GT\\n\\n\\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they\\'re more expensive than they\\'re\\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\\n\\nTercel -> Paseo\\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\\nCivic -> del Sol\\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\\n\\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn\\'t offer the power that some 4-doors\\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let\\'s take another example: the\\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\\nmoney for this type of car.  \\n\\n\\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it\\'s market\\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\\n\\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\\n\\n\\nMihir Shah\\n\\t \\n',\n"," 'From: mcmahan@netcom.com (Dave Mc Mahan)\\nSubject: Re: 8x oversampling CD player\\n\\n In a previous article, kolstad@cae.wisc.edu (Joel Kolstad) writes:\\n>In article <hcbC5un9L.DD0@netcom.com> hcb@netcom.com (H.

The filtering is not\\ninterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal\\nyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an\\nall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person\\'s\\nheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks\\nthat weren\\'t there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the\\nproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at\\nthat point.

Xt Glossary\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\\n\\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\\n  widgets or gadgets.\\n\\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\\n\\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly\\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\\non the visual being used.  \\n\\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\\nlittle harder because you\\'ll need to initialize much of the toolkit\\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\\n\\n/*\\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\\n * than the default visual.\\n *\\n * To compile:\\n *\\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\\n *\\n * To run:\\n *\\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\\n *\\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\\n * to install.\\n */\\n\\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\\n\\ntypedef struct\\n{\\n\\tVisual\\t*visual;\\n\\tint\\tdepth;\\n} OptionsRec;\\n\\nOptionsRec\\tOptions;\\n\\nXtResource resources[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n\\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n};\\n\\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\\n\\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\\n};\\n\\n\\n\\nint\\nmain (argc, argv)\\n\\tint\\t\\targc;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**argv;\\n{\\n\\tXtAppContext\\tapp;\\t\\t/* the application context */\\n\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\t\\t/* toplevel widget */\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\t\\t/* display */\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**xargv;\\t/* saved argument vector */\\n\\tint\\t\\txargc;\\t\\t/* saved argument count */\\n\\tColormap\\tcolormap;\\t/* created colormap */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\tvinfo;\\t\\t/* template for find visual */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\t*vinfo_list;\\t/* returned list of visuals */\\n\\tint\\t\\tcount;\\t\\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\\n\\tArg\\t\\targs[10];\\n\\tCardinal\\tcnt;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*name = \"test\";\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*class = \"Test\";\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * save the command line arguments\\n\\t */\\n\\n\\txargc = argc;\\n\\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\\n\\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\\n\\t */\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\\n\\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   XtNumber (resources),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   args, cnt);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\\n\\t\\t/*\\n\\t\\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\\nsuch).\\n\\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\\nor just monochrome.\\n\\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\\'s offer all the above \\nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\\nshell.\\n\\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\\n\\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\\nvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n8.  I\\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n9.  Why doesn\\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\\n\\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\\nlist is traversed and each widget\\'s memory is actually free()\\'d, among\\nother things.\\n\\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\\n\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t}\\n\\nOne can see that the above code exit\\'s immediately after destroying\\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\\noccur.  \\n\\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\\n\\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\\ndifficult to maintain practices.\\n\\nTry the following code instead.\\n\\n\\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n\\n\\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern void ExitCallback (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tBoolean\\n\\tExitWorkProc (closure)\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t\\t/*NOTREACHED*/\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\\n\\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12. Why can\\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\\nnot fit most peoples\\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\\nOS\\'s it is the poll() system call.\\n\\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\\n\\nIt\\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\\nreliable.  In particular:\\n\\n\\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\\n\\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\\n\\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\\n\\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\\n\\n\\t- Pyramid, doesn\\'t work at all.\\n\\n\\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\\n\\t  sockets), wasn\\'t completely broken, but although the writing\\n\\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\\n\\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\\n\\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\\n\\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\\n\\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\\n\\t  been given the whole block).\\n\\n\\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\\'t also deal with signals at this\\npoint I don\\'t know.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13.

Keep\\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\\n\\ttypdef struct\\n\\t{\\t\\n\\t    String\\tname;\\n\\t    long\\tvalue;\\n\\t} Arg;\\n\\nand the code:\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\\n\\nexpands to\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\targ.name = \"name\";\\n\\targ.value = 3.2;\\n\\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\\nhow to get around this?\\n\\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\\n\\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\\\n    } else { \\\\\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\\\n    }\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\\n\\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\\n\\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\\n\\n    string to data type\\n    data type to string\\n    data type to data type\\n\\ni) string to data type\\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\\n\\n\\tName\\t\\tValue\\n\\t\"True\"\\t\\t1\\n\\t\"False\"\\t\\t0\\n\\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\\n\\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\\n    of the converters.\\n\\nii) data type to string\\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\\'t necessary.  Instead,\\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\\n\\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\\n\\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\\n    converter, it isn\\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\\n    that they are consistent.\\n\\niii) data type to data type\\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\\n    red, green and blue.\\n\\n\\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\\n\\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\\n    Display *dpy;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\\n\\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\\nconverted value:\\n\\ntypedef struct {\\n    unsigned int    size;\\n    caddr_t         addr;\\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\\n\\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\\nreturn True.\\n\\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\\n\\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\\\n\\t    { \\\\\\n\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n\\t      return False; \\\\\\n\\t    } \\\\\\n\\t  else \\\\\\n\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n\\t  return False; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\\nconverter is being called properly.\\n\\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\\n\\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\\nXtSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\\nused.\\n\\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\\n\\n    XtCacheNone\\t\\tDon\\'t cache any converted values\\n    XtCacheAll\\t\\tCache all converted values\\n    XtCacheByDisplay\\tCache converted values on a per display basis\\n\\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\\n\\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\\n\\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    XrmValuePtr to;\\n    XtPointer converter_data;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n\\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\\n\\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\\nR5 distribution:\\n\\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\\nand remove it from the application context.\\n\\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\\nhappen 3 ways:\\n\\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\\n\\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\\n\\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\\n\\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\\n\\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\\ndemonstrates this:\\n\\n#include <setjmp.h>\\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\\n\\nvoid\\nXIOHandler (dpy)\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\n{\\n\\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\\n\\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\\n}\\n\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\\n\\t\\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\\n}\\n\\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\\'s enough information in the\\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\\npurpose it is adequate.\\n\\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\\nconnect to a display.\\n\\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\\n\\n\\t1. Args passed at creation time.\\n\\t2. Command line arguments.\\n\\t3. User\\'s per host defaults file\\n\\t4. User\\'s defaults file.\\n\\t5. User\\'s per application default file.\\n\\t6. System wide per application default file.\\n\\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\\n\\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\\n\\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nbut most do not.\\n\\nA user may have many per application default files containing\\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\\nis found.\\n\\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\\n\\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open\\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n\\t%N\\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\\n\\t\\tapplication\\'s class name.\\n\\t%T\\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n\\t\\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\\n\\t%C\\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\\n\\t%S\\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n\\t%L\\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n\\t%l\\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n\\t%t\\tThe territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\t%c\\tThe codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\nLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is\\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so\\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\\n\\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\\n\\nWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\\nbatch of default settings.)\\n\\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory\\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\\n\\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\\nguarantee the order of execution.\\n\\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\\nlist.\\n\\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\\nsays:\\n\\n \\t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\\n \\tprocedure is to be appended.\"\\n \\nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\\nlist.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\\n\\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\\n> stays set to TRUE.\\n\\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\\n\\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\\n\\n> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something\\n> else which needs to be done?\\n\\nYou\\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\\n\\n> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest\\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \\n\\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\\nsuggestions.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\\nhandled something like:\\n\\n\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\\n\\t\\texit (1)\\n\\t}\\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\\n\\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\\n\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\\n\\telse\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\\n\\t++count;\\n\\nto be written as:\\n\\n\\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\\n\\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\\'ve\\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\\'m\\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\\n\\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\\nstructure or copying a string:\\n\\n\\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\\n\\t  char\\t     *ptr;\\n\\t  char\\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\\n\\n\\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\\t/* takes care of type casting */\\n\\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\\n\\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\\n\\n\\t char\\t      *ptr;\\n\\n\\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\\n\\t /* ... */\\n\\t free (ptr);\\n\\nmay not work.  Personally, I\\'d call any implementation that did this\\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\\n\\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFirst, I\\'d recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\\'s.  It\\'s a bit pricey\\nat $2750 but I\\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\\n\\n\\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\\n\\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\\n\\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\\n\\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\\n\\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\\n\\tmalloc\\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\\n\\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\\n\\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\\n\\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\\n\\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\\n\\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\\'s nearly\\n\\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\\n\\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\\n\\nAn alternative package that isn\\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\\nmany Unix\\'s and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\\nfor more info)\\n\\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\\'ll need to run in\\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\\'t run in synchronous\\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\\nserver are asynchronous.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    example% xload -xrm \\'*XtDebug:true\\' &\\n    example% xwininfo -tree\\n\\t     <click in new xload window>\\n\\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\\nof errant widgets.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\\ntest the way a widget manages it\\'s children, you can try\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\\nof both.  It\\'s a very clever idea.\\n\\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\\'ll need to\\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\\nUnfortunately you can\\'t give them because all the input is going to\\nyour application which is stopped.\\n\\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\\nusing a command sequence like this:\\n\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\t# Your favorite debugger.\\n\\tor this:\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\n\\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\\n\\t(gdb) run ...\\n\\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\\n\\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\\ndeal.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n26. Why don\\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \\n\\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\\nyou won\\'t get those events.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\\n\\n\\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\\n\\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\\n\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\\n\\nwould never invoke the timeout.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\\n\\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\\n``intuitive\\'\\' fashion.\\n\\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\\nsupported d-n-d all along.

My\\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\\nas it is based on Xt).\\n\\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\\nconventions, for more details read the code.\\n\\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\\n\\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\\n\\t     from surface.\\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft.

LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\\n\\t      1972.\\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\\'s\\n\\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\\n\\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\\n\\t      1976.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\\n\\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\\n\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\n\\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\\n\\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\\n\\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\n\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\\n\\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\\n\\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\\n\\t       similar in 1969.\\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\n\\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\n\\t       1972.\\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\\n\\t       first probe to orbit Venus.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\\n    public and university library.

Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" \\n\\nJohn Nunnally\\n',\n"," 'From: cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer)\\nSubject: Re: Professors Whining About Pay\\n\\nIn article <1qf2kqINNrkd@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov>, fogarty@sir-c.jpl.nasa.gov (Tim Fogarty) writes:\\n> In article <15320@optilink.COM>, cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:\\n> |>In article <1q4k3bINNe6k@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov>, fogarty@sir-c.jpl.nasa.gov (Tim Fogarty) writes:\\n> |>> In article <15307@optilink.COM>, cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:\\n# |## |#2.

The bibliography for the article cited a\\n> philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I\\n> believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral\\n> person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a\\n> person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.\\n\\nThis is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior\\nto us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced\\nand therefore \"more intelegent\" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there\\nis life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have\\nno clue as to weather they are \"intelegent\" or not.\\n\\n>    I think you\\'d have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The\\n> human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does\\n> underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The\\n> usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the\\n> culture.  This may not always be wrong, but that\\'s the way to bet.\\n\\nThat\\'s a good point, I hadn\\'t thought of it that way.  My question however was\\nmore along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars\\nand giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign\\ncountries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.\\nWould we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn\\'t resolved\\nthese issues on our own?\\n\\n\\nBut... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided\\nthat certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior\\nto our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no\\nhomelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and\\nmore.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm\\nthe land and go to church on sunday?\\n-- \\nHave a day,\\n\\n  @   @\\n   ( )     bobo\\n',\n"," 'From: mtf@vipunen.hut.fi (Antti Lahelma)\\nSubject: Re: Atheists and Hell\\n\\nIn <Apr.19.05.14.08.1993.29279@athos.rutgers.edu> atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) writes:\\n\\n>  Hello,\\n\\n>  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the \\n>newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.  \\n>Unfortunately I don\\'t have direct quotes handy...\\n\\n>1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.\\n\\n More correctly: when people die, they cease to exist.\\n\\n>2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death\\n>   is unfair.\\n\\n>  I don\\'t see what the problem is!

They are posted with his permission.  The\\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\\n\\n-------\\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\\nSubject: Clipper Chip\\n\\n\\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday\\'s NY Times,\\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\\nif I have anything wrong):\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \\nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \\nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \\nspecific. I don\\'t know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \\ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \\nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \\nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \\nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \\nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \\nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \\ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \\nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \\nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \\nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \\npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \\nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\\n\\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \\nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \\nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \\nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \\nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \\nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \\nproducing\\n\\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n\\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \\nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \\nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \\nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \\ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \\nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \\n\\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\\n\\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \\nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \\nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \\nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\\n\\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \\nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \\nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \\nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \\norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \\nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \\nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford\\'s attorney general (right\\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \\nNo single person or authority should have the power to\\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\\n\\nMartin Hellman\\n\\n----\\n\\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: smb@research.att.com\\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\\n\\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \\nif you also post this message with it in which:\\n\\n1.

If neither the output or\\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\\n\\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\\n\\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\\n\\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\\n\\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \\nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\\n\\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\\n\\nHope this helps at least get you started.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\",\n"," \"From: chris.crayton@ozonehole.com (Chris Crayton) \\nSubject: Ibm link to imagewriter -\\n\\n*** On 04-20-93  21:25, Larry Henson had the unmitigated gall to say this:\\n\\n LH> Hello, I am trying to hook an Apple Imagewriter to my IBM Clone.\\n LH> I seem to have a problem configuring my lpt port to accept this.

Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast\\nthe next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to\\npeople who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer\\nfor Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and\\nso Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.\\n\\nMr. Schiff was correct, and so won.

Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.\\n\\n- Mark\\n',\n"," \"From: rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu (Rich Haller)\\nSubject: ReSound hearing aid theory as I understand it\\n\\nThe following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in\\nHearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other\\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\\n\\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\\nout in 'noisy' situations.\\n\\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\\n\\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\\noff a cliff).\\n\\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \\n\\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\\nUSA\\n\",\n"," 'From: bbenowit@telesciences.com (Barry D Benowitz)\\nSubject: PRK (Photo Refractive Keratostomy)\\n\\nFor those of you interested in the above Procedure, I am able to add the\\nfollowing facts:\\n\\n1) This Procedure is not done in Philadelphia.\\n\\n2) It is performed in Maryland at Johns Hopkins for corrections between\\n   0 and -5 and from -10 to -20 (diopters, I think are the units).\\n\\n3) It is performed in New York City at Manhattan Eye and Ear for corrections\\n   between 0 and -6.\\n\\nThe magic words to use when requesting information on this is not PRK (they\\nthink you mean RK) but the excimer laser study (or protocol).

Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.

I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers.

I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame.

The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model.

Within Protestantism, it\\'s a matter\\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\\nwho don\\'t.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I\\'d \\nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\\n\\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between\\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\\n  Church of Christ\\n\\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\\nquite marked.\\n\\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I\\'m away from my\\nlibrary at the moment, so I don\\'t have anything specific to recommend.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n"," 'From: jkatz@access.digex.com (Jordan Katz)\\nSubject: SSRT Roll-Out Speech\\n\\n                               SSRT ROLLOUT\\n\\n                Speech Delivered by Col.

For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\\nhand!\\n\\n     This project is real.

Since it hasn\\'t\\nbeen posted for some time (and I\\'ve modified it somewhat since the\\nlast time), I\\'m taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nmean homosexual.  Here\\'s what he says: The two Greek words that appear\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.\\n\\nMany people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug\\naddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s OK.\\nMost of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people\\nget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be\\nattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if\\nwe view it as wrong) wouldn\\'t be different than any of these other\\nthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or\\nanother having to work to overcome bad habits and particular\\ntemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say\\nthat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus\\nsaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying\\nto self (which also appears throughout Paul\\'s letters) seems to\\nsuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we\\nare called on not to accept.  Paul\\'s letters and the experience of\\nChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and\\nthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that\\nhomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn\\'t necessarily say it\\'s OK.\\nMaybe this isn\\'t the place where we have to die to self.  But I\\'d like\\nto make sure that those who think it isn\\'t are fighting the battle\\nsomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have\\nto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.\\n',\n"," 'From: HOLFELTZ@LSTC2VM.stortek.com\\nSubject: Re: Question: Jesus alone, Oneness\\n\\nIn article <May.5.02.53.16.1993.28886@athos.rutgers.edu>\\njblanken@ccat.sas.upenn.edu (James R.

It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That\\'s really sad if\\n> it is, because I fail to see how it\\'s less than completely sensible.\\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don\\'t like it, for whatever\\n> inexplicable reasons.\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.

This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\\nI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\\n\\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\\nother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)\\n\\n> You\\'d like Posner, Bill.

I grant you that when\\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\\nappears, those of David Koresh.\\n\\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J.

LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.

However,\\nduring\\nthis process I have come up with new problems.\\n\\n1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic\\nstring.

This\\ntechnique has\\n   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must\\nalways be in a\\n   state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB\\nsends.\\n\\nAre all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect\\nassumptions?\\nAre there any better work arounds to the above?

But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".

The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.

Armenian Math Problems\\n\\n\\nFrom: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46\\n\\n\\tThe Problem Book of Anania of Shirak\\n\\t------------------------------------\\n\\n\\t\\t\"On the ancient peak of Ararat\\n\\t\\tThe centuries have come like seconds\\n\\t\\tAnd passed on.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-Avetik Issahakian\\n\\nby Yuri Danilov\\n\\nSome years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \"What\\nbooks would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\" And \\nthough the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, \\ndepending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, \\nand celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, \\nnot one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at\\nleast one book of arithmetic problems.\\n\\nSome of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they \\nwere trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \"numbers\" (though \\nsecretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain.

I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\\n\\n *\\n\\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\\n(Mr Holly\\'s father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\\nMasons.)\\n\\nThe SBC\\'s Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\\n\\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\\naren\\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\\ninfluenced how the report came out.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\\n\\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.

The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n',\n"," \"From: Rob Earhart <earhart+@CMU.EDU>\\nSubject: Re: Animation with XPutImage()?\\n\\ndcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk (Derek C.

(was Re: My Gun is like my American Express Card)\\n\\n/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /\\n\\n>I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun,\\n>but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT?  You still haven\\'t offered\\n\\nI\\'ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I\\'d rather face a knife than\\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\\nsame thing, then I got \\'educated.\\'\\n\\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don\\'t understand that\\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\\n(within a minute or so) death.\\n\\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\\n\\'try their luck\\' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\\nonly in a single direction and it\\'s only advantage is that it is a\\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\\n\\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\\nability of it\\'s wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\\nstrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\\nslashing attacks of novices.  I\\'ve talked to several well trained\\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\\nthe attacker.\\n\\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\\nknife attacks in prison.\\n\\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\\ncast managed it in two.  I\\'ve seen people close that distance and strike\\nin 1 second.  I\\'m old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\\nseconds.  I\\'ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\\npointed end.)\\n\\nAdd to this the \\'fact\\' that hand gun \\'stopping\\' power is largely a myth.\\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\\nseconds for a bullet wound to \\'take effect.\\'\\n\\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn\\'t think\\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\\nattacker, you\\'d better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional \\'center of mass\\' and\\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\\ncaliber powerful enough to \\'do the job.\\'  Hot .38\\'s on up will usually\\ndo this.\\n\\nRemember folks, the idea isn\\'t to \\'take em with you\\' but for you to live\\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\\n\\'killing them\\' isn\\'t our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\\nus alive.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\\nknow, I can\\'t rightly say I\\'d rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\\nWOULDN\\'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\\nwhatever it takes.\\n\\nRick.\\n',\n"," \"From: umlangston@msuvx1.memst.edu (Mark C.

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner\\'s manual:\\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\\n    panning for each voice\\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\\n    access to all eight voices\\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \\n    modulation sources and routings.\\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\\n    the SQ-80.\\n\\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\\n\\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\\nto use so I have avoided it.\\n\\nREASON FOR SALE:\\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\\n\\nPRICING AND TERMS:\\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \\npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \\noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner\\'s manual.\\n\\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n',\n"," 'From: dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian)\\nSubject: Re: Seventh Century A.D.

The new cryptography scheme was\\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\\n\\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA\\'s role in the creation of\\nsuch standards.\\n\\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\\ndeveloping the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\\nDSS.\\n\\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\\nadministration\\'s apparent commitment to the privacy of\\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today\\'s official\\nstatement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\\nthe propriety of NSA\\'s role in the process and the apparent\\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\\npublic scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\\nestablished openly and with full public participation.  It is\\nnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\\nsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\\nplay a leading role in the development process.\"\\n\\n        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\\nindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\\ntechnology on society.

Azeri views on this dispute have\\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\\n\\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\\n\\nThe following should be interesting. \\n\\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\\n1991, page 28, we read:\\n\\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \\n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\\n\\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\\n\\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \\npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\\n\\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\\n[AR] history of the conflict.\\n\\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\\n \\n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\\n\\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\\n \\n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\\n \\nIt\\'s called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn\\'t try to deport and allow the \\nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\\nplay dead. \\n\\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\\n[AR] possessions?\\n\\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\\n \\n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\\n\\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\\n \\n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\\n\\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \\nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\\nhave us believe.\\n \\n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\\n\\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\\nclaim. \\n\\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \\ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \\n\\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \\nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \\nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \\nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\\nwas stated as 11,000.\\n\\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\\n\\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828.

The Armenian\\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\\nassuming no Kurds!\\n\\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\\n\\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\\n  Republic.\\n\\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tN. Narimanov\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople\\'s Commissar for Foreign Affairs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGuseinov\"\\n\\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\\n[AR] rule. \\n\\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\\n\\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\\n\\nNon-sequitur. \\n \\n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\\n\\nArmenian historians don\\'t say this!\\n\\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\\n\\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \\nargument totally invalid!\\n\\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\\n\\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\\n\\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\\n\\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\\nArmenians.\\n \\n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\\n\\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\\npopulation! \\n \\n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\\n \\nAzerbaijan\\'s refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \\nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict.

Well, who cares.\\n\\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\\n\\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \\nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \\n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\\nwhich is now ready to work.\\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\\nwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\\nAt beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\\nbefore sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\\nchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\\nand the session key. This might look like\\nX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\\nwhere X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\\nThis family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\\nAfter that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\\nbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\\n\\nDenning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\\nBit's.\\n\\nNow, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\\nbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\\nscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\\n\\nAs far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \\nobvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\\nthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\\nimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\\nfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\\n\\nThen, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\\ncould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\\neach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\\nassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\\nlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\\nand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\\nand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\\nchip is compromised forever.

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400.

But before I do, I want to \\nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \\nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \\ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \\nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \\nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \\nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \\nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \\na problem with one of these diseases, don\\'t use what I\\'m going to tell you \\nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \\nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \\nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that\\'s why I\\'m here).  When \\nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn\\'t say, don\\'t worry my vitamin \\nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \\nplan and simple.  If it\\'s begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \\nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \\nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor\\'s office as fast as \\nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \\nregular basis, my wife kept putting her\\'s off, both myself and her \\ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \\nscheduled one, but she didn\\'t show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \\nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\\n\\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \\nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \\nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \\ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \\nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \\nminerals are being used.  I\\'m not saying that some of this stuff couldn\\'t \\nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \\nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D\\'s who wrote the new \\nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \\ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \\nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \\nhandle stress.  That\\'s where I\\'m coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\\nI\\'m not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \\ndon\\'t care.  I\\'m averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \\nthat I\\'ve got something important to say.  But I\\'m also getting hit by a \\nfew with an axe to grind.  That\\'s life.\\n\\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \\nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \\nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \\nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \\nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \\nchelate(chromium picolinate) it\\'s absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \\nfor all the minerals).  I\\'ve been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \\ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \\ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \\ndo any harm.  I wouldn\\'t do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \\nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \\n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \\nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \\ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \\nType II diabetes but I\\'m not going to because for each positive one, there \\nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I\\'m convinced that the problem is \\nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \\nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \\nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \\nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \\nconcerned\\n\\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \\nthis possible link with chromium isn\\'t too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \\nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \\nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \\nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \\npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \\nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \\nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \\npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \\njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \\nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \\nfound in older people, it\\'s not too surprising that chromium was low in the \\nRBC\\'s.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \\nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \\ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\\n\\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \\nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \\nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \\nanalysis for you, but I wouldn\\'t use them.  There is just too much funny \\nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\\n\\nHere\\'s Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \\nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \\navailable(they don\\'t like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \\nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \\nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \\nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \\nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \\nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \\nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\\n\\nWhat\\'s my advise?  Don\\'t take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \\nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \\nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \\na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \\nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \\nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan\\'s new Clinical Nutrition textbook \\nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \\ntolerance.  If you can\\'t do that, I\\'ll find a doctor who can, thank you \\nvery much.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n"," \"From: baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca (Baden de Bari)\\nSubject: Blue LED's\\n\\n \\n        So what's the story here... we're all stuck with the regular\\ngreen, red, and off yellow-orange LED's!?

However,\\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I\\nwas very disappointed.\\n\\nYou're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's\\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\\nthese issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd\\nhate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like\\nhim very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but\\nintentional) use of the stick.\\n\\nGary\\n\\n\\n\",\n"," 'From: jhesse@netcom.com (John Hesse)\\nSubject: Re: Secret algorithm [Re: Clipper Chip and crypto key-escrow]\\n\\nIn article <strnlghtC5LGFI.JqA@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) writes:\\n>\\n>\\n>Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\\n>less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\\n>secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \"goat\" can\\n>eavesdrop.

Thus,\\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \\npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \\nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\\ncountries.\"[1]\\n\\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions.

In addition \\nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \\nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns.

Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).

If I\\ndon\\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\\'ll use it.\\n\\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\\nlow cost (it\\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\\nbillion for the US share.\\n\\nI didn\\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\\'d bet that\\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\nthat\\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\\'s round\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\\'s supply of consumables and\\nequipment would weigh?\\n\\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?

Aren\\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \\nI\\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\nDC-1.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\\n\\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\\nam not a diving expert).\\n\\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \\npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I\\'m sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\\n---\\n .

So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.
